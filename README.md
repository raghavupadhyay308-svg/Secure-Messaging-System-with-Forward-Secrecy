# Secure-Messaging-System-with-Forward-Secrecy
The Secure Chat project is a Python-based encrypted messaging system using hybrid encryption. AES (via Fernet) secures messages, while RSA safely exchanges AES keys. All data is encrypted using the cryptography library and stored locally, ensuring no plaintext messages or keys are exposed.
